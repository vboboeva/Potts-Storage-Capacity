# REPOSITORY CONTAINING CODES USED FOR THE POTTS MODEL PROJECT

THREE MAIN COMPONENTS

1) THE PATTERN GENERATOR ALGORITHM

v5: - parents are defined as subsets of children over subsets of units so we introduce N_fact
	- parent units take different states
	- we add zeta as dominance parameter
	- we add a small random input in case sparsity of input (a_pf) is too small and the algorithm doesn't generate enough patterns


2) SIMULATING POTTS MODEL TO COMPUTE ITS STORAGE CAPACITY


3) FINDING FIXED POINTS OF THE MEAN-FIELD EQUATIONS YIELDING STORAGE CAPACITY
